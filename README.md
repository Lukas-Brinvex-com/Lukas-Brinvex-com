I am an experienced and certified Java developer with a strong focus on simple, clean, and maintainable code and architecture.

Detail-oriented, I excel at solving complex problems, 
supported by a solid theoretical foundation in computer science, mathematics, and finance.
I am committed to delivering thoughtful, reliable solutions that stand the test of time.

I prioritize long-term strategies and prefer proven, simple technologies over fleeting trends or hype.
My critical thinking and unique perspective enable me to create solutions that work well and can be relied on.

Friendly, patient, and hardworking, I bring a positive and dedicated approach to every project I work on.
